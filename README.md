Welcome to the frontend for KitchenApp, my WIP personal project to help me manage items in my kitchen inventory and stop buying duplicate items. KitchenApp is designed to facilitate the management of items typically found in a kitchen, such as groceries and other household supplies. Here's an overview of what the application will do:

1. **Checklist Management**:
   - Users can create and maintain a checklist of items they need to purchase.
   - They can add new items to the checklist with details like item name, quantity, and category.
   - Individual checklist items can be updated (partially) by changing their name, quantity, category, and purchased status.
   - Users can also delete items from the checklist.
   - Checked off items can be automatically moved into the kitchen inventory

2. **Inventory Management**:
   - Users can view a list of items in their inventory, including details like item name, quantity, and category.
   - New items can be added to the inventory, either by manually entering them or by marking items from the checklist as "in inventory."
   - Inventory items can be updated (partially) by changing their name, quantity, and category.
   - Users can delete items from their inventory.

3. **Category Management**:
   - Users can view a list of categories that classify items in their inventory.
   - New categories can be added to the list.
   - Existing categories can be updated by changing their names.
   - Categories can also be deleted.

Overall, the application is going to be a tool for helping users keep track of their kitchen-related items. It can be used for grocery shopping, managing household supplies, and categorizing items for better organization
